title: Week 1: Getting to Know the Concept of Open Source
---

The first time I heard the term “open source” was in an intro level web programming class at NYU. When the professor talked about the history of web programming, he briefly introduced us to the concept of “copyleft” and the creation of GNU. Since then, I have regarded the free sharing of code as the core value of open source projects. After the first week in this class, now I have a more comprehensive understanding of open source projects: they are projects with valid open source licenses whose source code can be freely viewed and shared. 

Compared with closed source, open source has many advantages. First of all, open source softwares are usually free, which enables more users to download and make use of them. The large number of users in turn provide developers with a lot of feedback which helps improve the software. Also, developers and students are able to view the source code of open source softwares and learn from it. Furthermore, the idea that anyone can view and make changes to the source code gives everyone the chance to contribute to the projects, and enables hundreds of thousands of developers to work together under one project towards a common goal. The size and functionality of softwares can develop faster as ideas about new features can come from an increasing number of people.
